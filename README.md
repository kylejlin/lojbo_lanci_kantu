# Particles

To use the app, [click here](https://kylejlin.github.io/chs-class-apparel/particles/).

## Using the app

- Press the `e` key and click to add an emitter.

- Press the `r` key to remove the most recently added particle emitter.

  - There is no way to undo a removal, so be careful!

- Press the `p` key to turn the emitters on or off.
  When the emitters are on, they emit particles.
  When they are off, they do not.

- If you press the space key, the particle animation will pause as soon as you release it.
  To resume the animation, hold down the space key, and the animation will continue running for as long as you hold down the key.

- Press a number key to load a preset.

  - `1` will load "Seniors"
  - `2` will load "21"
  - `3` will load "Cupertino"
  - `4` will load "High"
  - `5` will load "School"
  - `6` will load the ring
  - `7` will load "2021"

- Press the `t` key to toggle the particle emitter types between orange particle emitters and yellow particle emitters.

- To download an image of what you see on the screen, right click and then click "Save Image As", just as you would download an ordinary image.

  - The background of the downloaded image will be transparent.
